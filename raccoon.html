    <h1>Raccoon</h1>
    <p>Raccoons are mammals native to North America.<br>
    While their original habitat is in forests, they were able to adapt to mountainous areas, marshes, and even urban areas like New York City.<br>
     Raccoons are able to carry rabies, so it is recommended to avoid them.</p>
